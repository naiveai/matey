A BitTorrent client written in Rust.

## Usage

`matey` currently only supports a limited subset of
real-world torrent files, the primary type defined in [BEP
0003](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html). This means no support for
multiple announcers or the DHT protocol. In practice, unfortunately, this means
that most real-world torrents don't work with it, but a good deal do, such as
those distributed by mainstream Linux distributions, for instance.

`cargo run <filename>`
